\large{\textbf{Abstract}} Theme of our paper: "Things that are the most powerful in the public setting might not be optimal in the private setting"\\
\textbf{Keywords: differential privacy, one-way ANOVA, F-test.}

\section{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Motivate differential privacy
\item We are looking to test for differences in many group means
\item Our statistics are ratios of measures of discrepancy and measures of variability.
\item Explain why we are modifying F-statistic (not as powerful in private setting). Touch upon our justifications using the language of test theory.
\item side by side comparison with Zach's plots and our prettiest plot
\item Rule of thumb when to use which statistic
\end{enumerate}
