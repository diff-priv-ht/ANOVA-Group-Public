For preparing for arxiv (from Anna):

1. Remove '\graphicspath{}' command and put images/ directly in the \includegraphics calls.

2. Removed the dvipdfmx option from \includepackage{graphicx} (this caused errors for me)

3. Put all .tex files in the ms.tex document (including macros.sty)

4. Set \pdfoutput=1 so it's a PDF.

5. Added authors and affiliations like the arxiv template (found it on overleaf but it's other places as well).

MAKE THE ZIPPED FILE:

tar -cvzf CLEAN_VERSION.tgz images/ ms.tex ms.bbl arxiv_style.sty
